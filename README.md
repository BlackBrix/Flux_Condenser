# Flux Condenser

A tiny (35mm x 25mm) PCB badge featuring 24 LEDs that animate to create the “fluxxing” effect. It’s 100% decorative, it doesn’t actually let you travel through time when worn around the neck.

It is contolled by a Microchip ATtiny44A microcontroller. Thankfully this board has a much lower power requirement than the silkscreen indicates on the back, and skips along, sipping power from the single CR2032/LIR2032 coin cell battery (instead of plutonium or a lightning strike), slipped into the rear mounted coin cell holder.
